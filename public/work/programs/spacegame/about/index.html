			<p><i>Game With No Title</i> is a space-themed twin-stick dungeon crawler currently under development. The game features <i>Man With No Name (MWNN)</i>, as astronaut who has just left his home planet, <i>Probably Not Earth (PNE)</i>. He'll probably use one of these storylines:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><i>MWNN</i>'s significant other has been kidnapped by space aliens or pirates or something, and he's going throughout his solar system to save her</li>
				<li><i>MWNN</i> works for NASA/etc, and he has been sent on a mission to study/collect samples from the sun. <i>PNE</i> would probably be on the edge of the solar system, and <i>MWNN</i> would go from planet to planet to get to the sun, then from planet to planet to get back. Might use a time limit or something?</li>
				<li>Suggestions welcome! (I'm bad at writing)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Gameplay concepts:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Each planet will represent a "floor," will be procedurally generated, and will ideally feature unique enemies</li>
				<li>The player will travel between planets via shuttle, and must gather fuel on each planet to continue</li>
				<li>Enemies will use aggro, and will attack the player within a certain distance of their starting point</li>
				<li>The player will attack via some sort of gun/projectile weapon</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Possible concepts:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>Different weapon types (possibly borderlands-style weapons?)</li>
				<li>Shuttle fuel is collected all at once, and protected by a boss</li>
				<li>Shuttle fuel is collected by exploring each planet until enough is collected (could need to be refined, and a boss could attack while refining?)</li>
			</ul>
