	"desc": 	"A shirt designed for my band, and printed through my internship. Unfortunately, a band with three designers in it means it's pretty hard to make everyone happy. I ended up designing the compass, revising it, getting some changes made against my will, and having someone else design the monogram, but I (and a couple friends) still wear it, years later."
