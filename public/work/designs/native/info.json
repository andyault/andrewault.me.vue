	"desc": 	"For my senior year of high school, I was lucky enough to be able to intern with a company called Native Sons Screenprint & Embroidery in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. During my time there, and between other small assignments, I was asked to come up with possible designs that the company could put on tags for their garments. Although none of my designs made it to production, I'm still thankful for the experience, and they're still one of the projects I'm most proud of."
